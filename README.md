Google Maps API

## Instructions

Follow This before running the Project

First get your Google Maps Android and iOS SDK, Places and Directions API Key _(request one [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-api-key); if you're using an existing Google Maps API Key make sure you've enabled the Google Maps,  Directions and Places API for that key using the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/))_.

Then set a `.env` file with `GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE" 

Once this is done, you can use `expo start` to run the project
